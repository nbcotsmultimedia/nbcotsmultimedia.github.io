            Hi Nina! Can we still make a few small changes in the climate menu?
            Just one or two, I promise. Just kidding! Seriously I will miss our
            joint projects, your patience helping me get my laptop camera
            working, early morning trips to the commissary. Best of luck with
            your new opportunity - <em>Noreen</em>
          </p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>
            Nina, you are such a wonderful colleague and will be so very much
            missed! Your creativity, humor and thoughtfulness have made every
            day brighter. You're a brilliant visuals producer, but I have to say
            I'm going to miss getting to work with you on your (funny!
            inventive!) text articles just as much. So happy for you as you take
            this next opportunity and will be cheering you on every step of the
            way! - <em>Kelly</em>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>
            Nina, it's been awesome working with you these past few years. You
            were instrumental in bringing together the NBC & Telemundo teams,
            always thinking about pulling Telemundo folks into the conversation
            and offering your expertise to help us elevate the quality of our
            projects. I'll especially miss our laughs during AM/PM editorial
            meetings and your witty sense of humor that made boring meetings a
            lot more bearable. You'll be greatly missed. I'm extremely happy for
            you and this new chapter in your journey, wishing you all the best!
            - <em>Sergio</em>

            Nina, congrats on your new opportunity! Excited to hear more about
            it. We will definitely miss you here -- a lot!! Tons of memories
            with you in such a short time -- early Olympic mornings on Slack,
            finally meeting in person at 30 Rock and of course the holiday
            party. Wishing you all the best and don't be a stranger! -

            Nina, I’m going to miss you so much! When you visited Dallas a few
            years ago, we took you to get Tex Mex & it was your first time
            eating queso. You’ve been trying to find queso that good since then
            in New York without success. &#128514; You’re welcome back to DFW
            ANYTIME! And I’ll never forget our collaboration on “THIS is the
            face of an ant.” &#128028; Epic! I know you will succeed where ever
            you go and your future coworkers are lucky to have you. Please keep
            in touch. - <em>Holley</em>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>
            Nina, we'll miss you so much! My New Favorite Olympian in NYC, your
            skillful photography and the delicious Italian dinner we had after
            with a cameo by a The Bachelor star will always be a core memory.
            Wishing you the best in your next chapter! - <em>Fernando</em>

            Nina, it's been a wild 7 years and it's been an absolute delight to
            see how much you've grown in that time. I know you will absolutely
            destroy it at your next stop! - <em>Nelson</em>

            Nina - So sad to see you go! Thank you for being an all-time great
            colleague. 30 Rock will never be the same without you, and your
            sense of humor will be uniquely missed. You've been such an
            important part of our team. I wish you all the best in your next
            endeavor and I hope we can stay in touch. If I ever buy a racehorse

            Nina, THANK YOU! &#10084; Thank you for always thinking in
            Telemundo, for appreciating our work (even quick translations), for
            having patience when our local editors made crazy requests and
            wanted them for the same day, for making our meeting so much fun,
            and for making us feel part of the team since day 1. You’re AWESOME!
            I wish you all the best and I’ll miss you a lot. - <em>Johanna</em>

          <p>
            Nina - it's been such a pleasure working with you and seeing you
            grow over the past seven years. Your humor and wit made any meeting
            or project more fun, and of course your skill and professionalism
            made sure the project ended up amazing. You always challenged
            yourself and pushed yourself to learn more and expand your skill
            set, which made the whole team better, and set a great example for
            others. You've been such an amazing member of this team, and we'll
            miss you! - <em>Josh</em>

            Nina - there’s no one else I’d rather talk to at 4am about Getty
            Images than you. You will be so missed!! I can’t thank you enough
            for teaching me some of your tips and tricks on finding the best
            wire images, for always being willing to support me at work and in
            life, and for always putting things into shrewd perspective. It’s
            been amazing to watch you become a mama and I’ve loved being able to
            lean on you for advice - and I’ll never be able to adequately thank
            you for all the baby clothes you sent. You’re a real one and we were
            all better off for having had you on our team for so long! Excited
            to see what you do with your next ventures!! - <em>Janine</em>

            Nina — From Stony Brook to 30 Rock to wherever our paths cross next.
            The office will not be the same without you, and not only because
            you are a highly talented and knowledgeable asset who can
            efficiently juggle photography, IT support and any other assignment
            thrown your way. But also because your hatred for all of the things
            I love has made for such fascinating daily conversation. Wishing you
            all the best in your next chapter. You will be greatly missed.
            Coworkers no longer, friends forever….Oh, and I’ve arranged for the
            bar to play an episode of “Seinfeld” during your Happy Hour. Enjoy!

            Nina, we met through journalism and a lot of our daily interactions
            were based around “the news of the day.” Away from the desk and all
            of its endless duties though, I got to get to know you more and how
            passionate about you were about the craft. I’m really bummed you’re
            leaving our team as the job won’t be the same without you but at the
            end of the day it is just that - A JOB. The fact you’ve found
            something that pays more and keeps you home is what’s most
            important. Plus, I am confident our paths will intersect again real
            soon. And, when they do, I know it will be FAR from the turnstile
            that is covering natural disasters, bizarre animal stories, the
            Olympics and the tragedies that freeze time and floor you. For all
            those moments and more - thank you!!! You’re truly blessed visually
            and creatively and I wish you nothing but the best endeavor. I have
            your contact info and we will be getting the boys together soon.
            Best of luck to you in your new endeavor. I know you’re going to
            CRUSH it. - <em>Steve</em>

            Nina- I was very lucky to meet you in person during my only three
            months working from 30 Rock. I remember you were one of the first
            persons that I met as they sat me across from your desk, and you did
            not hesitate to reach out. You supported me in many ways, and it was
            a pleasure to collaborate on your incredible AI project. You’re a
            very talented artist and I cannot wait to see the great things that
            you’ll pursue in your next adventure. You will be missed! -
