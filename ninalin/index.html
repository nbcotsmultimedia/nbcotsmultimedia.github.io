          <p>Hi Nina! Can we still make a few small changes in the climate menu? Just one or two, I promise. Just kidding! Seriously I will miss our joint projects, your patience helping me get my laptop camera working, early morning trips to the commissary. Best of luck with your new opportunity - <em>Noreen</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, you are such a wonderful colleague and will be so very much missed! Your creativity, humor and thoughtfulness have made every day brighter. You're a brilliant visuals producer, but I have to say I'm going to miss getting to work with you on your (funny! inventive!) text articles just as much. So happy for you as you take this next opportunity and will be cheering you on every step of the way! - <em>Kelly</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, it's been awesome working with you these past few years. You were instrumental in bringing together the NBC & Telemundo teams, always thinking about pulling Telemundo folks into the conversation and offering your expertise to help us elevate the quality of our projects. I'll especially miss our laughs during AM/PM editorial meetings and your witty sense of humor that made boring meetings a lot more bearable. You'll be greatly missed. I'm extremely happy for you and this new chapter in your journey, wishing you all the best! - <em>Sergio</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, congrats on your new opportunity! Excited to hear more about it. We will definitely miss you here -- a lot!! Tons of memories with you in such a short time -- early Olympic mornings on Slack, finally meeting in person at 30 Rock and of course the holiday party. Wishing you all the best and don't be a stranger! - <em>Logan</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, I’m going to miss you so much! When you visited Dallas a few years ago, we took you to get Tex Mex & it was your first time eating queso. You’ve been trying to find queso that good since then in New York without success. &#128514; You’re welcome back to DFW ANYTIME! And I’ll never forget our collaboration on “THIS is the face of an ant.” &#128028; Epic! I know you will succeed where ever you go and your future coworkers are lucky to have you. Please keep in touch. - <em>Holley</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, we'll miss you so much! My New Favorite Olympian in NYC, your skillful photography and the delicious Italian dinner we had after with a cameo by a The Bachelor star will always be a core memory. Wishing you the best in your next chapter! - <em>Fernando</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, it's been a wild 7 years and it's been an absolute delight to see how much you've grown in that time. I know you will absolutley destroy it at your next stop!  - <em>Nelson</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina - So sad to see you go! Thank you for being an all-time great colleague. 30 Rock will never be the same without you, and your sense of humor will be uniquely missed. You've been such an important part of our team. I wish you all the best in your next endeavor and I hope we can stay in touch. If I ever buy a racehorse I will name it "Racehorse Name Generator" in your honor. - <em>Emilie</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Congratulations on the new opportunity, Nina! You've been such a great resource for me since I've started on news. From special graphics to other projects, you've helped make my stories look so much better! Thanks for everything and best of luck wherever you go! - <em>Max</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina - I am so sad to see you go! I appreciated your patience will all my questions and requests. You have been a great colleague and I will miss working with you. Oh wait, before you go, can you please find me a photo of a Capitol rioter carrying a sword and a shield? - <em>Mike Topel</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, THANK YOU! &#10084; Thank you for always thinking in Telemundo, for appreciating our work (even quick translations), for having patience when our local editors made crazy requests and wanted them for the same day, for making our meeting so much fun, and for making us feel part of the team since day 1. You’re AWESOME! I wish you all the best and I’ll miss you a lot. - <em>Johanna</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina - it's been such a pleasure working with you and seeing you grow over the past seven years. Your humor and wit made any meeting or project more fun, and of course your skill and professionalism made sure the project ended up amazing. You always challenged yourself and pushed yourself to learn more and expand your skill set, which made the whole team better, and set a great example for others. You've been such an amazing member of this team, and we'll miss you! - <em>Josh</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina - there’s no one else I’d rather talk to at 4am about Getty Images than you. You will be so missed!! I can’t thank you enough for teaching me some of your tips and tricks on finding the best wire images, for always being willing to support me at work and in life, and for always putting things into shrewd perspective. It’s been amazing to watch you become a mama and I’ve loved being able to lean on you for advice - and I’ll never be able to adequately thank you for all the baby clothes you sent. You’re a real one and we were all better off for having had you on our team for so long! Excited to see what you do with your next ventures!! - <em>Janine</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina — From Stony Brook to 30 Rock to wherever our paths cross next. The office will not be the same without you, and not only because you are a highly talented and knowledgeable asset who can efficiently juggle photography, IT support and any other assignment thrown your way. But also because your hatred for all of the things I love has made for such fascinating daily conversation. Wishing you all the best in your next chapter. You will be greatly missed. Coworkers no longer, friends forever….Oh, and I’ve arranged for the bar to play an episode of “Seinfeld” during your Happy Hour. Enjoy!  - <em>Mike Gavin</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, we met through journalism and a lot of our daily interactions were based around “the news of the day.” Away from the desk and all of its endless duties though, I got to get to know you more and how passionate about you were about the craft. I’m really bummed you’re leaving our team as the job won’t be the same without you but at the end of the day it is just that - A JOB. The fact you’ve found something that pays more and keeps you home is what’s most important. Plus, I am confident our paths will intersect again real soon. And, when they do, I know it will be FAR from the turnstile that is covering natural disasters, bizarre animal stories, the Olympics and the tragedies that freeze time and floor you. For all those moments and more - thank you!!! You’re truly blessed visually and creatively and I wish you nothing but the best endeavor. I have your contact info and we will be getting the boys together soon. Best of luck to you in your new endeavor. I know you’re going to CRUSH it. - <em>Steve</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina, proud to have sat next to you at 30 Rock! You are truly a swiss army knife of a producer and we will miss you! Congratulations on your next chapter. Come back and visit us! And remember, I know where you live &#128516;  - <em>Julia</em></p>

          <hr class="darker" />

          <p>Nina- I was very lucky to meet you in person during my only three months working from 30 Rock. I remember you were one of the first persons that I met as they sat me across from your desk, and you did not hesitate to reach out. You supported me in many ways, and it was a pleasure to collaborate on your incredible AI project. You’re a very talented artist and I cannot wait to see the great things that you’ll pursue in your next adventure. You will be missed!  - <em>Miguel</em></p>
