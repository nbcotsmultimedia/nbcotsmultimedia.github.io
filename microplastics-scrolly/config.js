        "Virgin plastic production starts small, with tiny pellets called nurdles â€“ typically less than 5mm in size.",

      content:
        "Plastic containers become part of our daily lives, from food packaging to retail products. Once discarded, plastic waste can travel far from disposal sites. Wind, rain, and wildlife can carry these items into storm drains and waterways.",

    {
      title: "Breakdown",
      content:
        "Environmental forces break down plastic items into progressively smaller pieces, eventually creating particles smaller than a grain of sand. This process can span 20-500 years, depending on plastic type.",
    },

      title: "Ocean Distribution",
      content:
        "From visible pieces to microscopic particles, plastics spread throughout aquatic ecosystems, from surface waters to the seafloor.",

      title: "Marine Impact",
      content:
        "Marine life encounters these particles primarily in two ways: through their gills while feeding, and by mistaking them for food.",

      title: "Ocean Floor",
      content:
        "In the deepest parts of the ocean, tiny particles are suspended like snow and settle on the seafloor",

      title: "Commercial Fishing",
      content:
        "Commercial fishing boats inadvertently collect more than fish. Their nets sweep up both suspended microplastics and marine life that has already ingested or absorbed these particles.",

      title: "Food Chain",
      content:
        "Marine microplastics can travel through the food chain, from fishing vessels to restaurant kitchens.",

      title: "Water Systems",
      content:
        "Even advanced water filtration systems cannot remove all microscopic plastic particles, particularly those smaller than 1 micron, allowing some to persist in drinking water.",

      title: "Human Impact",
      content:
        "Recent scientific studies have detected plastic particles in human blood samples, digestive organs, and other body systems.",

      title: "Research",
      content:
        "Medical researchers continue to investigate potential biological interactions, while long-term studies on health impacts are ongoing.",

      title: "Environmental Persistence",
      content:
        "While plastic breaks down into smaller particles, it never fully biodegrades in the natural environment.",

        "Production continues, and the cycle of plastic circulation goes on.",
