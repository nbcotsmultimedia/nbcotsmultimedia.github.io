          Consider this example with 100 votes. In ranked-choice voting, a candidate needs at least 50% of votes to win.
          So if any candidate receives at
          least 50% of first-choice votes, they automatically win the race.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-1">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-1">
          But in the likely scenario that none of the candidates receive at least 50% of first-choice votes, low-ranking
          candidates are eliminated and their votes are
          redistributed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-2">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-2">
          Once all votes are cast, they are distributed between the nine candidates. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-3">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-3">
          At first, your vote goes to your first-choice candidate.

      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-4">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-4">
          If your first-choice candidate has enough votes, they will move on to the next round.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-5">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-5">
          But let's say your first choice is eliminated. Then your vote will go to your second-choice candidate.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-6">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-6">
          As candidates are eliminated, their votes are redistributed to voters' next-highest-ranked choice.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-7">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-7">
          Your vote could stay with your second choice candidate, but if they are also eliminated, your vote will go to
          your third choice, and so on.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-8">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-8">
          Let's say your third-choice candidate never gets eliminated, so your vote ultimately counts toward them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-9">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-9">
          That doesn't guarantee that they will win the race. A candidate may make it to the final round, but if they
          are not the first to reach 50% of votes, they still lose the race.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-10">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-10">
          Of course, there is always the scenario where your candidate does win the race.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="ranked-choice-slide" id="ranked-choice-slide-11">
        <p class="ranked-choice-caption" id="ranked-choice-caption-11">
          And a scenario where every candidate you ranked is eliminated, meaning your vote ultimately does not count
          toward the election.
