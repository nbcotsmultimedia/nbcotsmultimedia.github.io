                away</h4>

                <p>Robin Finley was diagnosed with uterine cancer five years ago and has undergone repeated treatments
                    since it reoccured. Now she struggles with the added worry of wondering whether she can even get her
                    chemotherapy drugs, amid a continuing shortage of key medications.</p>
                <p>She was halfway through a regimen last year when one of the two drugs she was taking, carboplatin,
                    became scarce. She said that no one involved with her treatment could tell her exactly what had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>"It was unsettling and scary, to have a life-saving drug suddenly disappear, without explanation,"
                    said Finley, who lives in Caledonia, New York, south of Rochester. "Without anybody being able to
