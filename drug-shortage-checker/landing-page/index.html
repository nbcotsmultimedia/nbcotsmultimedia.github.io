        <p>In this three-part investigation, we'll expose a public health emergency hiding in plain sight. Through
            in-depth
            interviews with healthcare professionals, patients, and industry experts, we'll explore the human cost of
            these
            shortages and proposed solutions.</p>

        <p>Meet the doctors improvising with dwindling resources, the shadowy corporate middlemen pulling the strings of
            a
            fragile
            supply chain, and the patients whose lives hang in the balance.</p>

        <p>We'll explore how the collision of razor-thin profit margins, outdated infrastructure, and corporate
            interests
            may make
            your next prescription impossible to fill - and what it means for the future of American health care.</p>

                <p>Robin Finley was diagnosed with uterine cancer five years ago and has undergone repeated treatments
                    since it reoccured. Now she struggles with the added worry of wondering whether she can even get her
                    chemotherapy drugs, amid a continuing shortage of key medications.</p>
                <p>She was halfway through a regimen last year when one of the two drugs she was taking, carboplatin,
                    became scarce. She said that no one involved with her treatment could tell her exactly what had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>"It was unsettling and scary, to have a life-saving drug suddenly disappear, without explanation,"
                    said Finley, who lives in Caledonia, New York, south of Rochester. "Without anybody being able to
                    tell me anything because they didn't know anything."</p>
