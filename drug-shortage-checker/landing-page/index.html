                <p>Robin Finley was diagnosed with uterine cancer five years ago and has undergone repeated treatments
                    since
                    it
                    reoccured. Now she struggles with the added worry of wondering whether she can even get her
                    chemotherapy
                    drugs, amid a continuing shortage of key medications.</p>
                <p>She was halfway through a regimen last year when one of the two drugs she was taking, carboplatin,
                    became
                    scarce. She said that no one involved with her treatment could tell her exactly what had happened.
                </p>
                <p>"It was unsettling and scary, to have a life-saving drug suddenly disappear, without explanation,"
                    said
                    Finley, who lives in Caledonia, New York, south of Rochester. "Without anybody being able to tell me
                    anything because they didn't know anything."</p>
